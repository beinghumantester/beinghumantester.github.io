#  Test Plan – A Brief Overview

A **Test Plan** is a detailed document that outlines the **strategy, scope, approach, resources, and schedule** for the testing activities of a project. Think of it as a roadmap that guides the testing process—what to test, how to test, who will test, and when.

*Includes: test cases, test data, bug reports, test summary.*

### 6. **Roles and Responsibilities**
Specifies who is responsible for different tasks in the testing process.  
*Example: Tester prepares test cases, QA lead reviews them.*

### 7. **Schedule and Milestones**
