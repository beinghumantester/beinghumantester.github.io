## Description

Who owns testing standards in your project? Who decides release gates? Who pays the cost of test debt?

Many open source projects cannot answer clearly. Not because maintainers do not care, but because test health responsibility emerges informally rather than being explicitly defined. What remains informal becomes nobody's obligation until it turns into everyone's problem.

Examining governance docs, contributor guidelines and issue discussions from Linux kernel, Kubernetes, Apache and OpenStack, this talk surfaces a recurring pattern: investing in CI alone does not clarify who owns test health. Kubernetes has a testing SIG and extensive CI, yet flaky test discussions reveal uncertainty about who can enforce fixes.

## Four practical steps projects can adopt:

- Make testing ownership explicit in governance and contributing documentation.
- Define release quality gates that are written, versioned and enforced.
- Designate CI health stewardship the way projects designate release managers.
- Track flaky test debt the way projects track open issues.

Open source conferences focus on tools. This talk focuses on ownership: a framework for identifying and closing gaps in test health responsibility.
