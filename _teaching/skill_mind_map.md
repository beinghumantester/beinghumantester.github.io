## Why Every Tester Needs a Skills Map

In testing, it is easy to get caught up in the cycle of running test cases, reporting bugs, attending standups, and moving to the next task. But over time, the real challenge is not just doing the work. It is about understanding where we are heading and how we are growing.

Thatâ€™s why I created this skills map.

The image below is a personal visual of how my testing journey connects with the different skills I have picked up along the way. From technical concepts to mindset and tools, I wanted to put everything in one place. Not because it follows a perfect structure, but because that is how I often work some skills support others, some overlap, and many evolve depending on the project or team I am part of.

Having this kind of map makes a big difference.

For testers, it becomes easier to reflect on where they stand today and what they might want to learn next.
For recruiters, it gives a clearer view of what a balanced tester can look like beyond the usual testing labels.
And for learners or managers, it opens the door to conversations about capabilities, interests, and possible growth areas.

This skills map is not a checklist or a certificate. It is just a way to bring clarity when things feel scattered or confusing. Because sometimes, answers are not as important as simply being able to see the whole picture in one place.
