# Ujjwal Kumar Singh ‚Äì Portfolio Website

This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio website, built using the [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/) Jekyll template, originally based on the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

The site is designed to present my professional journey, testing projects, written work, and curated resources all in one place.

About the Theme
This site is based on the Academic Pages template, which was forked from the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme. While it originally served academic needs, I have adapted and maintained a detached version tailored to reflect my profile and portfolio.

For issues or suggestions related to the core theme, please refer to the Academic Pages GitHub repository.

Thank you for visiting. Whether you're here to explore my work, collaborate, or learn more about software testing practices... welcome!
