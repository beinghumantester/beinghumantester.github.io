Growth Driven Testing by Pradeep Soundarajan is a book that quietly challenges a belief many testers carry without realizing it:
that growth in testing comes automatically with years of experience.

After around four years in testing, this book felt like a mirror. Not uncomfortable in a dramatic way, but honest. It highlights something that is easy to ignore when daily work is full of execution—writing test cases, attending calls, logging bugs, meeting deadlines—but reflection and intentional growth slowly disappear from the routine.

What I appreciated most is that this book does not equate growth with tools, automation skills, or job titles. Instead, it focuses on how a tester thinks, learns, and adapts over time. The idea that growth is driven by curiosity, feedback, and conscious effort—not just by being busy—felt very real. Many testers work hard for years but plateau without realizing why. This book explains that gap clearly.

From a practical point of view, the examples resonate strongly with everyday testing work. Situations like repeating the same testing approach across projects, relying too heavily on checklists, or avoiding difficult conversations because “that’s how things are” are discussed openly. The book nudges you to ask better questions:
What am I learning from this project?
What assumptions am I carrying forward without validating them?
Am I improving my judgment, or just repeating tasks faster?

Philosophically, the book connects growth with awareness. You cannot grow if you are not aware of your limitations, blind spots, and comfort zones. That idea hit hard. It made me reflect on moments where I blamed process, timelines, or management, without asking how I could adapt my own approach as a tester. Growth, as described here, is not aggressive or competitive. It is gradual, reflective, and deeply personal.

Another strong takeaway is how the book treats mistakes. Instead of framing them as failures, it positions them as data points for growth. In real testing life, mistakes are inevitable—missed bugs, wrong assumptions, poor communication. The book encourages learning from those moments rather than carrying guilt or defensiveness. That mindset alone can reduce a lot of internal pressure testers feel.

This is not a book that gives you “do these five things and grow faster.” It requires patience. Some parts may feel abstract if you are early in your career, but with a few years of experience, the ideas land differently. You start connecting them to real incidents, real feedback, and real frustrations you have already lived through.

Overall, Growth Driven Testing is less about becoming a “better performer” and more about becoming a more conscious tester. It helped me step back and look at my career not just in terms of skills acquired, but in terms of thinking evolved. For testers who feel stuck, confused about next steps, or quietly wondering whether they are truly growing, this book offers clarity—not loud motivation, but steady direction.

It does not promise fast results. It encourages slow, meaningful progress. And in a profession that often values speed over depth, that message feels necessary.
