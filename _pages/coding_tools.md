# My Testing Toolkit: Not Just Tools, but Trusty Companions

*Some tools came my way while I was just exploring  
Some stayed because they helped me fix tricky bugs  
Each one has its own use  
Together, they make testing a bit smoother every day *

# Tools I Use for Writing Code  
- PyCharm – My main IDE for working on Python projects  
- VS Code – Quick and lightweight, good for small tasks  
- Notepad++ – Handy for quick edits and logs  
- Eclipse – Mostly for Java-based work
