# Coding Tools I Keep Going Back To  

*These are the coding tools I use every day. Nothing fancy , just reliable tools that help me write better code and solve problems. Even though I tried many over the years, but these are the ones I keep coming back to.*

# Tools I Use for Writing Code  

- **PyCharm**  
  When I’m working on Python projects, this is my go-to. It understands my code better than I do sometimes, and the debugging feels smooth.

- **Visual Studio Code**  
  Clean, quick, and flexible. I often use it for light edits, Markdown writing, or when I just want to open a folder without loading a whole IDE.

- **Notepad++**  
  My forever friend for checking logs, comparing files, or making quick notes. Light and reliable.

- **Eclipse**  
  This one comes out when I’m working with Java. A bit heavy, but still gets the job done when I need it.

*Some days it's about building features  
Other days, it's just staring at logs  
Either way, the tools help keep things moving*
