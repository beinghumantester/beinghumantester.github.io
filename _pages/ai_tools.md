# AI Testing Tools That Help Me Move a Bit Faster, Think a Bit Deeper  

*I used to write every test from scratch  
Then came tools that could suggest, assist, and sometimes surprise me  
They don’t replace testing  
But they do make it a little smarter and a little faster*

# AI-Based Tools I Use for Testing  

- **Katalon**  
  It simplifies test creation with its low-code approach. Great when I want to automate without spending hours writing boilerplate. Helpful for both beginners and when I just want to get things done quickly.

- **Postbot**  
  This one lives inside Postman and brings AI suggestions to the table. Whether it’s generating test scripts or improving API request structure, Postbot gives helpful nudges along the way.

*AI doesn’t test for me  
But it does help when I’m stuck  
And on those long testing days  
That’s more than enough*
