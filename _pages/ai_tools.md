# My Testing Toolkit: Not Just Tools, but Trusty Companions

*Some tools came my way while I was just exploring  
Some stayed because they helped me fix tricky bugs  
Each one has its own use  
Together, they make testing a bit smoother every day *


# AI Tools I Use for Testing  
- Katalon – Makes automation a bit easier  
- Postbot – Helpful in testing APIs with AI suggestions
