# My Testing Toolkit: Not Just Tools, but Trusty Companions

*Some tools came my way while I was just exploring  
Some stayed because they helped me fix tricky bugs  
Each one has its own use  
Together, they make testing a bit smoother every day *


# Tools I Use for Performance Testing  
- JMeter – For load and stress testing  
- Lighthouse – Great for checking website performance  
- GTMetrix – Helps track page speed  
- Postman – Sometimes useful for quick performance checks
