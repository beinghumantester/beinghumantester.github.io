# Performance Testing Tools That Help Me Catch the Lag  

*Fast websites make users happy and keep things working when lots of people visit. These tools help me figure out if a site is truly ready for real traffic or if it might fall apart when busy.*

# Tools I Use for Performance Testing  

- **JMeter**  
  A solid pick for load testing. It might look old-school, but it does the job well when I need to simulate real-world traffic and monitor how the system holds up.

- **Lighthouse**  
  Quick insights into how fast, accessible, and optimized a web page is. I like using it when I want instant feedback on what’s slowing a site down.

- **GTMetrix**  
  A great way to see where a web page is lagging. It helps break down performance scores and gives a visual timeline of what’s loading and when.

- **Postman**  
  Not just for APIs. I sometimes use it for testing response times under different conditions or when I want to check how consistent an endpoint behaves with heavier loads.
