# Frameworks I’ve Built, Tweaked, and Worked With  

*Frameworks don’t magically solve problems  
But they set the rhythm for writing cleaner, repeatable tests  
These are the ones I’ve worked with  
Some I built from scratch, some I inherited and made better*

# Frameworks I Use in My Testing Projects  

- **Pytest**  
  My favorite for Python automation. Clean, powerful, and easy to plug in with plugins. I’ve used it for both simple and complex test suites.

- **Rest Assured**  
  When it comes to API automation in Java, this one's been rock solid. It fits well into CI pipelines and works smoothly with TestNG or JUnit.

- **Behave**  
  For BDD-style automation in Python. Handy when working in teams where readability and collaboration matter more than just scripts.

*Testing gets better when the foundation is strong  
These frameworks give me that base to build on*
