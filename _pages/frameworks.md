# My Testing Toolkit: Not Just Tools, but Trusty Companions

*Some tools came my way while I was just exploring  
Some stayed because they helped me fix tricky bugs  
Each one has its own use  
Together, they make testing a bit smoother every day *

# Frameworks I Work With  
- Rest Assured – For testing REST APIs  
- Pytest – My favorite for Python automation  
- Behave – When I want to follow BDD style
