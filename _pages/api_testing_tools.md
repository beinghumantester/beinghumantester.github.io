# API Testing Tools That Help Me Talk to Servers Without Losing My Cool  

*APIs are like conversations between systems  
Sometimes they whisper, sometimes they scream  
These tools help me understand what’s being said  
And make sure the message is getting through, clearly and correctly*

# Tools I Use for API Testing  

- **Postman**  
  My most-used tool for sending and testing requests. Whether it's checking a simple GET call or chaining multiple requests in a workflow, Postman handles it all with ease. I also use it for creating collections and saving test cases.

- **Swagger**  
  I often start here to understand what an API is supposed to do. It’s helpful when reading through documentation and testing endpoints directly, especially during early development stages.

*APIs don’t always respond the way we expect  
But with the right tools, it’s easier to ask the right questions  
And catch what’s broken before the users do*
