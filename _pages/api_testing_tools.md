# My Testing Toolkit: Not Just Tools, but Trusty Companions

*Some tools came my way while I was just exploring  
Some stayed because they helped me fix tricky bugs  
Each one has its own use  
Together, they make testing a bit smoother every day *


# Tools I Use for API Testing  
- Postman – My go-to for testing APIs  
- Swagger – Useful for reading and testing API documentation
