# CI/CD and Version Control Tools I Trust When Things Need to Just Work  

*Getting tests to run consistently is just as important as writing them. These tools help me schedule tests, track results, and make sure everything's working as it should.*

# Tools I Use for CI/CD Integration  

- **Jenkins**  
  Simple, stable, and powerful. It runs my tests the moment a change is pushed. I’ve used it for triggering builds, scheduling test runs, and keeping a regular flow between dev and testing.

- **Docker**  
  Helps me test in clean, isolated environments. No more “works on my machine” drama. I can spin up the same test setup again and again.

- **Selenium Grid**  
  Useful when I want to run tests across multiple browsers or systems. It’s like having a mini lab without needing a room full of devices.

# Version Control Tool I Use  

- **GitHub**  
  This is where everything lives – code, test scripts, bugs, fixes, regrets. Whether it’s managing branches or tracking changes, GitHub helps me stay organized and not lose sleep over overwritten files.

*CI/CD isn’t about being fancy  
It’s about being reliable  
These tools make sure the pipeline doesn’t break, even if I do*
