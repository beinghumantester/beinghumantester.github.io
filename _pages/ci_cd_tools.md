# My Testing Toolkit: Not Just Tools, but Trusty Companions

*Some tools came my way while I was just exploring  
Some stayed because they helped me fix tricky bugs  
Each one has its own use  
Together, they make testing a bit smoother every day *


# Tools I Use for CI/CD Integration  
- Jenkins – Automates my test runs  
- Docker – Helps in creating clean test environments  
- Selenium Grid – Useful for running tests on different browsers  

# Version Control Tool I Use  
- GitHub – For storing and managing all my code
