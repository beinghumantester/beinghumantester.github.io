# My Testing Toolkit: Not Just Tools, but Trusty Companions

*Some tools came my way while I was just exploring  
Some stayed because they helped me fix tricky bugs  
Each one has its own use  
Together, they make testing a bit smoother every day *


# Tools I Use for Inspecting Elements  
- DevTools – Built into the browser, very helpful  
- SelectorHub – Makes finding XPath and selectors easier
