# My Testing Toolkit: Not Just Tools, but Trusty Companions

*Some tools came my way while I was just exploring  
Some stayed because they helped me fix tricky bugs  
Each one has its own use  
Together, they make testing a bit smoother every day *
 

# AI Tools I Use for Daily Work  
- ChatGPT – Helps with ideas, bugs, and documentation  
- Claude – Another smart tool I use for writing and reviewing  
- Copilot – Supports me while writing code
