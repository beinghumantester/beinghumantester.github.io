# AI Tools That Make My Day-to-Day Work Easier  

*These tools don’t write code for me  
But they do save time, suggest better ways, and help me stay focused  
I don’t rely on them completely  
But they’ve become a part of how I work every day*

# AI Tools I Use Regularly  

- **ChatGPT**  
  From debugging ideas to writing rough drafts for documentation, it’s like having a brainstorming partner who never sleeps.

- **Claude**  
  I use it when I want longer, clearer writeups or need to reframe a thought. Feels a bit calmer in tone, which helps while reviewing things.

- **GitHub Copilot**  
  Shows up inside my editor with useful code suggestions. Sometimes it finishes my thoughts, sometimes it just reminds me what I forgot.

*Not magic  
Just quiet support when the mind is tired and the to-do list is long*
